 ## 🔍 Problem Description

 Unaware of the changing soil conditions, climate shifts, and nutrient imbalances, many Indian farmers continue to select crops using traditional methods. 
 This leads to:
 - Low yield and monetary loss
 - Overuse of fertilisers
 - Unidentified soil illnesses


 ## 💡 Smart Crop Advisor: Our Solution

 A web-based intelligent assistant that makes recommendations for the best crop to cultivate based on
 - environmental and soil data;
 - optional sensor inputs;
 - Symptoms of the disease and the time of sowing

   ### 🧠 Machine Learning Powered |  🛰️ IoT Capable | 📱 Farmer Centric


## 🔑 Key Features

|  🌟  Feature                    | ✅ Description |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| 📊 **Crop Recommendation**   | Recommends best crop depending on soil, area, month, and duration |
| 🧪 **Soil Health Advisory**  | Suggestions for pH balance, NPK correction, and moisture improvement |
| 🧬 **Disease Predictor**     | Predicts diseases and solutions from visible symptoms |
| 🌐 **Simple UI for Farmers** | Simple form-based UI with real-time output |
| 🔌 **Offline Support**       | With local JSON, Firebase/IoT integration ready


##  🧠  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS(optional), JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **ML Model**: Scikit-learn (Trained on agricultural dataset)
- **Database**: Local JSON / Firebase-ready
- **IoT (Future-ready)**: ESP32 + Soil Moisture + pH + DHT Sensors


##  🎯  How It Works

1. 🌱 **Input**:
   - Type of soil, area, sowing month, duration
   - Optional sensor readings (NPK, pH, moisture)
   - Observable disease symptoms (if any)

2. 🧠 **Processing:**
- ML model predicts the ideal crop
   - System gives fertilizer and soil improvement tips
   - Suggests disease diagnosis and solutions

3. 📋 **Output**:
   - Recommended crop name
   - Manure quantity & application schedule
   - pH/moisture improvement suggestions
   - Possible disease alert
